#Selective Search

###This paper introduced selective search algorithm, which is aimed at addressing the problem of generating possible object locations for use in object recognition.

##- Task overviem

See the figure below, the selective search algorithm aimes to detect the object.

####Defination

An image can be represented by G(V,E), V is the vertices, in image, the vertices is the pixles. E is the edge, in image, the edge connects the neighboring vertices. w(vi, vj) describes the dissimilarity between two vertices
